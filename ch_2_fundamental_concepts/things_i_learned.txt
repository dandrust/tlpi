File/Directory terminology

pathname is broken into a diretory and a base

directory is zero or more directories
base may be a directory or a File

pathnames may be absolute (beginning with a reference to the root = `/`) or relative 


File IO system calls work with file descriptors, which point to a file via number that the kernel provides
`stdio` provides the `FILE` file stream abstraction on top of file descriptors

fork() - called by parent process.  Creates a new process, the child process
execve() - replace text, data, heap, and stack with a new program
